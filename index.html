Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to program essentially a survey to determine whether the user has strep or a cold.
Since the cold and strep are similar and it can be difficult to discern which you have sometimes, this program
goes through a series of symptoms in order to help the user better understand what their illness could be.
 
Known Issues:
This list is not exhaustive and should not be used to diagnose any kind of medical condition.
